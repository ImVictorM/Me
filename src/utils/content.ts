  about: `
  My interest in development started back in 2020, influenced by a friend, I started studying web development by myself. The first programming language I had contact was JavaScript.
  
  Nowadays, I am focused on earning my place and creating a thriving and healthy career as a developer.
  
  Beyond coding, you can find me playing games, lifting weights or just enjoying the pleasure of standing on the ground just breathing and listening to a podcast.
